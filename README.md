# Playing with MPI

This repository contains examples and exercises related to the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for parallel computing. The goal of this repository is to help users gain experience with the MPI library and learn how to implement parallel computing solutions in various programming languages.


## Introduction

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed for parallel computing. It allows developers to write programs that can run on multiple computers, communicating and synchronizing tasks via message passing.

## Requirements

- An MPI implementation (e.g., Open MPI, MPICH) installed on your system
- A C/C++ or Fortran compiler, depending on the examples you want to run

## Examples

This repository contains various examples showcasing different aspects of MPI. Examples are organized into subdirectories based on the programming language used:

- [C++ examples](./cpp_examples)
- [Fortran examples](./fortran_examples)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/apetridis/playing_with_mpi.git
```

2. Change to the desired example directory.

3. Compile the example using the appropriate compiler and MPI wrapper.
